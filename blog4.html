          <b>The Prophet ﷺ said:</b> "The most beloved of Allah’s servants are those with the best manners."
          <br>(Reference: Sahih al-Bukhari 6029)<br> <br>
          Akhlaaq is not just about being polite — it’s about living with integrity, compassion, and kindness in every
          aspect of life. As a Muslimah, your character is your greatest strength. So how can we nurture it? <br>
        <p>
        <h3>Be Gentle in Speech</h3> <br>
        The Prophet ﷺ was known for his soft and pleasant speech. Even when he corrected others, his words carried
        wisdom and care. When you speak, let your words be soft yet firm, kind yet clear. <br>
        "And speak to people kindly..." (Qur'an 2:83)</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Control Your Anger</h3> <br>
        It’s easy to lose patience when things go wrong. But true strength lies in controlling your temper. <br>
        <br><b>The Prophet
          ﷺ taught us:</b> "The strong person is not the one who can wrestle others; the strong person is the one who
        can
        control themselves when angry." <br>(Reference: Sahih al-Bukhari 6114) </p>
        <p>
        <h3>Show Mercy & Forgiveness</h3> <br>
        People will hurt you — that’s a fact. But choosing to forgive shows strength, not weakness. Allah loves those
        who forgive, and He promises immense reward for those who let go of grudges.
        "... and those who control their anger and forgive others — Allah loves the doers of good." (Qur'an 3:134) </p>
        <p>
        <h3>Be Honest, Even When It’s Hard</h3> <br>
        Truthfulness builds trust. Whether it’s admitting your mistakes or speaking honestly, your integrity reflects
        your imaan.
        The Prophet ﷺ said: "Truthfulness leads to righteousness, and righteousness leads to Jannah." <br>(Reference:
        Sahih al-Bukhari 6094) </p>

        <p>
        <h3>Kindness in the Little Things</h3> <br>
        A smile, a thoughtful message, or a kind word can brighten someone’s day. Don’t underestimate these small acts —
        they hold immense value in the eyes of Allah. <br> <br>
        <b>The Prophet ﷺ said:</b> "Even a smile is charity." <br> (Reference: Jami` at-Tirmidhi 1956)</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Patience in Trials</h3> <br>
        Life will challenge you — heartbreak, failures, or loss. But patience is your anchor. <br> <br> <b>The Prophet ﷺ
          promised:</b>
        "No fatigue, illness, anxiety, sadness, or hurt afflicts a believer except that Allah expiates some of their
        sins." <br> (Reference: Sahih al-Bukhari 5641, 5642)</p>

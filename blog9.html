        The greatest blessing Allah has bestowed upon this ummah is The Quran. And The Quran was revealed in a language
        chosen by Allah Himself, The Arabic Language. <br><br>
        Allah says, "Indeed, We have sent it down as an Arabic Quran so that you may understand." <br>
        <b>[Surah Yusuf 12:2]</b> <br><br>
        This is not just any language. <br>
        This is the tongue in which Jibreel descended from the heavens, carrying the words of Allah to the heart of
        Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ . <br><br>
        It is so sad , the Quran is recited daily in our prayers, yet our heart does not taste it's sweetness.
        <br> <br>
        <b>Ibn Taymiyyah (رَحِمَهُ ٱللَّٰهُ) said:</b>"The Arabic Language is part of the religion, and knowing it is
        obligatory. For understanding the Quran and Sunnah is not possible without it." <br><br>

        Learning Arabic is not only for scholars. It is for every Muslim who wishes to taste the Qur'an with his heart,
        not just his ears. <br> <br>
        When we sincerely begin to learn this beautiful language, Allah will definitely open doors for us. <br> <br>Let
        us make a promise today. Just as we strive to earn for our dunya, let us also strive to earn the language of our
        deen. <br><br> Even if it takes years, every moment spent is ibadah. <br><br>
        This language carries a beauty, a power, and a depth that no other language can hold. <br><br>
        Everything beautiful requires effort. <br> <br>It is a key to our deen. When we will learn it, we will feel as
        if a door has opened. <br> <br>
        Life is slipping away. Days become months. Months become years. And the Qur'an waits, calling us to understand
        it directly. <br><br>May Allah grant us sincerity in learning this language. <br>Aameen

        <p>Life moves fast. We chase degrees, jobs, success, and approval from people.
          But at the end of the day, when we are alone in our thoughts, a quiet emptiness lingers. </p>
        <p> What is my purpose? What am I really doing in this world?
          These questions often strike us when life slows down, and we realize that all the noise
          we’ve been chasing doesn’t fill the silence inside.</p>
        <p>The truth is, this emptiness is a reminder that our soul is created for more than just
          worldly achievements. It longs for connection with Allah, for a life of meaning, and
          for deeds that will remain long after we are gone.</p>
        <p>We are forgetting something important.
          We chase everything… except Allah.
          We live in a world where people praise hustle and success. But no one tells us to pause and reflect:
          💭 What will happen after this life?
          💭 Where am I headed?
          💭 Am I truly preparing for the Hereafter? </p>
        <p> <b>Narrated Anas:</b> <br>
          <b>The Prophet (ﷺ) said:</b>
          "When a human being is laid in his grave and his companions return, and he even hears their footsteps, two
          angels come to him, make him sit, and ask him: 'What did you use to say about this man, Muhammad?'
          The believer will say: 'I testify that he is Allah’s slave and His Messenger.'
          Then it will be said to him, ‘Look at your place in the Hell-Fire. Allah has given you a place in Paradise
          instead of it.’ The Prophet (ﷺ) added, ‘The dead person will see both his places. ’But a non-believer or a
          hypocrite will say to the angels, ‘I do not know, but I used to say what the people used to say.’Then it will
          be said to him, ‘Neither did you know nor did you take the guidance (by reciting the Qur’an).’
          Then he will be struck with an iron hammer between his ears, and he will cry out—a cry that will be heard by
          everything near him except human beings and jinns." <br> <br>
          <b>(Reference: Sahih al-Bukhari 1338)</b>
        </p>
        <p>Now, imagine this moment. Hearing the footsteps of loved ones walking away. The people we spent our entire
          lives trying to impress, trying to make happy—all leaving us behind.
          What remains now? Our deeds. Our faith. Our relationship with Allah.</p>
